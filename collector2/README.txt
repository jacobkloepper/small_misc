This program was written in my senior year of high school as a project in an Android dev unit. It was tested on two different Amazon Kindle devices.

Looking back at it now, almost two years later, I see a slew of global variables and the stunning lack of private object data. 
While I am not particularly impressed with this project now, I still fondly look back at the time I spent creating it.

I hope that, someday, I have the desire to come back and rewrite this.
